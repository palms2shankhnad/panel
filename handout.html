          <p>Firstly, Thank you all those who have started using the Grievance Form to make your suggestions.  We are working on this feature to list out a summary of the Grievance entries on this website <b>(Coming Soon)</b>.</p>
          <p>As you all must have realised, the attempt here is to showcase a different approach to address any problem or situation.
            The problem at hand we realised was some useful feedback from people was being lost among all the other comments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our first principles are <b>'People first'</b>, <b>'Transparency'</b>, <b>'Accountability'</b> and mondernization is an approach that enables us stick to it.
          </p>
          <p>Would like to clear out a confusion that we as Shankhnad Panel are not fighting with the other Panel over agenda.
            Infact our agenda has been derived based on all the issues individual members have faced in the past 5 years.
            But we believe that we need to be open to refine our agenda so as to prioritize it only based on peoples suggestions.
            <b>THIS DIGITAL PLATFORM EMPOWERS ALL THE PEOPLE TO BE PART OF THIS CHANGE </b>
          </p>
          <p>We would appeal you all, to give an oppurtunity to our <b>Shankhnad Panel</b> where all the panlists share this mindset.</p>
          <p>Please use the Grievance link to post us any suggestions/questions/feedback. Your participation is our tonic.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
