          <b>Important post by Mr. Goswami everyone need to be aware of. Thank you Mr. Goswami for enlightening us with this knowledge</b>
          <pre>
          Hi Palms 2 Members, this message is to share some relevant information with you in the midst of the ongoing high voltage efforts by the Panels towards influencing the Members for the upcoming Society election. 

          To evaluate the sincerity of the Manifestos I had asked three simple questions from both the Panels. The initial enthusiasm to respond faded soon and none has directly responded to the questions. I expected to see innovative answers for questions 2 (reduce expenditure) and 3 (increase revenue), however, these were altogether ignored. This has helped call out the farce in the manifestos. 
          
          Following is the fundamental information in respect of Society finances which all the Members should be aware of (and one does not need Balance Sheet for this):
          •	Quarterly maintenance charges are paid by us under the Heads: (1) Service charge, (2) Insurance, (3) Water charge, (4) Sinking fund, (5) Education fund, (6) Supporting charge.
          •	Of the above, water charge is based on previous quarter actuals; sinking fund is the corpus set up as per the regulation and cannot be used for any other purpose; education fund is meant for training etc. only; Insurance is based on actuals. The Society is therefore left with only the Service charge and Supporting charge to manage all the remaining expenses.
          •	Palms 2 Society should be receiving around INR 256000 per month in Service charges. The expenses to be catered from this are: Lift AMC, electricity, security, legal, accounting, telephone / internet, IT Return, audit, AGM, election, pest control.
          •	Palms 2 Society should be receiving around INR 98000 per month in Supporting charges. The expenses to be catered from this are: salary of the staff, house keeping consumables, stationery, MINOR REPAIR WORKS.   
          •	One can estimate the meagre amount that would be normally available towards minor repairs. One can altogether forget major repairs without contribution from the Members.
          •	Apart from the above, Society has some income (transfer money, interest etc). It would be safe to assume this at 30000-40000 per month. Further, a significant source of revenue (car parking charges) was introduced about 5 years back.
          
          I hope Members are able make a judgement on the feasibility of the grand Projects promised in the manifestos without additional burden on the Members.  
          
          Next relevant question is, how the recent repair works have been funded. The arithmetic goes as following:
          •	As per the Contract between the Builder and the Flat buyers, the Builder is to be paid Estate Maintenance Charges (EMC). The EMC is set to be annually increasing at a fixed rate.
          •	For specific reasons (deficiencies), Palms 2 stopped paying the EMC charges to the Builder around 2031-2014 but we continued to collect the same from the Members. This collection has been stopped since COVID.
          •	The EMC corpus held with Palms 2 generated handsome interest. This interest money is said to have been used in the recent repair works. AND LIKELY THIS IS EXHAUSTED NOW.
          
          We are sitting on a time bomb:
          •	The Builder has used various means (carrot and stick) to get his due EMC. 
          •	Builder failed in his first arbitration attempt. I understand that he has now initiated the arbitration case afresh.
          •	I would expect the Builder to eventually win because, (i) he can prolong the case for years (until Palms 2 is exhausted), and he is doing just this, (ii) Not many in Palms 2 know / understand the case and as the people move, the gap will widen, (iii) the case is quite complex, takes a lot of personal time, would take months and counselling sessions with legal experts to gain understanding. 
          •	Palms 2 status on EMC: (i) we collected the principal amount for some years and it is expected that this amount is safe in banks, (ii) the collection is however stopped since COVID – so there is a gap in the principal amount claimed by the Builder and what we have in the Banks, (iii) over this, Builder has been imposing interest on the unpaid EMC, (iv) total gap may be around 3-4 times, this means that if we are having INR 2 crores in principal with us, the Builder would be claiming INR 6-8 crores.
          
          I hope the above is helpful in bringing out the core issue(s) and the priorities and would help the Members in making a judicious decision.
          
          You may further like to note that neither experience (education fund is anyways there) nor youth (how young is young!!!) is a pre-requisite for a good Managing Committee. One just needs to have intent, compassion, humility, and maturity (rather than childlike actions and reactions) for harmoniously managing a Co-operative Housing Society. Please pick up the best candidates (junk the panels, pick up the candidates) for the Society. Fortunately, this time, we have 15 to choose from.        </td>

          <b>Reply by Shankhnad Team to Questions raised by Shri Nathan.</b>            
          <pre>      
        1)	Building Repair and Paint Work
        Question :- What and Where to repair not mentioned ?
        Answer :- Internal Walls, Internal Ducts, Internal Pipeline, Internal Chajja, Internal Stair Areas
        
        2)	Duct Cleaning and Hygiene Maintenance
        Question :- Last 15 years this is done by housekeeping. What more you will do ?
        Answer :- If it is so cleaned, then why ground floor is stinking ? Proper maintenance by cleaning schedule has to be maintained. If there are some leakage issues or gutter issues in duct, then same must be resolved to get rid of stink. I hope this has to be planned by committee and should not depend on housekeeping?? Expecting the same from last committee.
        
        3)	Enhance CCTV Security System Implementation
        Question :- Last MC said they recently installed new cctv cameras with night vision. Do you want to spend more on the work already done? What else you will do ? 
        Answer :- Yes, last MC has done work under the supervision of Mr. Varun Agarwal, which was a good work. We have written that we have going to enhance it by implementing in more areas to check pet movement, unwanted people movement, any other issue. Further, there are some wear and tear issues in current CCTV systems, which will be improved as well. One Cycle 
        
        4)	Better Housekeeping Services and Cleanliness
        Question :- last 15 years this work is done by housekeeping what more you will do ?
        Answer :- This is the problem with your question. You think if work is allotted to housekeeping means, there is not need of monitoring and improvement. We have huge scope for improvement here. We can allocate different time fro different housekeeping staff. Cleanliness in ducts is an issue. We have to improve it. We might think of outsourcing the same by using same staff for better management and better results.
        
        5)	Rainwater harvesting
        Question :- Last MC said this job is already executed. Do you want to spend more on the job already done ?? 
        Answer :- If this is implemented properly, then why did we need tankers ?? Further, the entire implementation of Rain Water harvesting in still pending. Many pipes are open to ground area which we have to take care of and water must be routed to ground in proper manner. 
        
        6)	Parking Enhancement – Inside and Outside society
        Question :- Society has already exhausted with parking space. Where are you going to install new parking ?
        Answer :- First of all parking is not be installed. Enhancement means, we are going to enhance the No. of spaces with better management of parking space. We have huge scope of improvement in management of inside and outside area as well. We will mark our area same as mastermind 1 has done.
        
        7)	Society Office with one more staff
        Question :- But will it increase the maintenance
        Answer :- One more staff was approved in SGM/AGM earlier. We have to just implement it. It will release the pressure on one man. It will help to hear people’s grievance and help to smooth operations. One person will take care of member’s compliant and internal work. One person will take care of outside work, BMC work, Bank work, Accounts work etc.
        
        8)	Better Facilities for society play area and children
        Question :- But do we have additional space for children 10 years and above ?
        Answer :- We have ample of space in our society. We have to plan it, manage it and implement it.
        
        9)	Facilities for senior citizens
        Question :- What facilities please explain ? How will you raise the budget ?
        Answer :- We must have ramp at the entrance for wheelchair for senior citizens. We must have programs arranged by NGOs for Senior citizens. Bhajan Sandhya and other devotional programs will be arranged for senior citizens. It doesn’t need money, but need a will with zeal towards execution.
        
        10)	Use of My Gate with Digital Initiatives
        Question :- My Gate is already implemented. So what new you are going to do ?
        Answer :- My Gate is not implemented fully. My Gate App has huge facilities within it. Now My Gate is just working as a monologue. We can use My Gate as a Dialogue platform. Members can raise queries on My Gate, maintenance collection is possible, Many household items and services could be integrated for ease of life of members, Committee will be able to answer queries. All in all we can use the platform effectively and in a better way which is not happening at this point of time.
        
        11)	Use of Government Facilities for housing societies
        Question :- Could you kindly explain in detail
        Answer :- Yes Of Course. There are plenty of facilities we have from BMC, State Government, Central Government, Co-Op Housing Society Panel. For example, Mosquito fogging. We have not used this facility in years. We have to ask BMC to come and do it. Like this there are many facilities from different bodies which we could use. MP and MLA fund for pavers and other society facilities is one more example. We are missing this completely. Keeping one more resource will help us to use this point effectively.
        
        12)	Borewell Management and enhancement in capacity
        Question :- Waterbed Digging is already done till maximum Government Permissible limits. Are you suggesting breaking the rules laid by Government ?
        Answer :- This question itself is a accusation, but it is ok. Management and Enhancement means, maintaining the current borewells, cleaning them on regular basis, checking their motors and maintaining them, If waterbed is not enough, then asking authorities to make new norewell if needed and closing of existing borewell, etc. This is not against any rule.

            Infact our agenda has been derived based on all the issues individual members have faced in the past 5 years.
